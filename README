bytes-circle v2.6

bytes-circle is a program that shows statistics about bytes 
contained in a file as an ASCII circle graph of deviations from 
mean in sigma increments.

The program can be useful for statistically analyze the content of
files in a glimpse: text files are shown as a green centered crown,
compressed and encrypted files should be shown as equally distributed
variations with a very low CV (sigma/mean), and other types of files
can be classified between these two categories depending on their
ASCII vs binary content, which can be useful to quickly determine how
information is stored inside them (redis db, mmedia files, etc).
