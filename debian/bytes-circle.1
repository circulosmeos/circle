.SH NAME
bytes-circle \- Show byte statistics as an ASCII circle graph
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bytes-circle
.RI [-o\ {0|1|2|3}]\ [-Bbnruh]\ [-z\ {0-255}] " files" ...
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbytes-circle\fP is a program that shows statistics about bytes contained
in a file as an ASCII circle graph of deviations from mean in sigma increments.

By default, byte 0 is at the center of the circle and next bytes until 256
are situated counterclockwise around the center.

bytes-circle expects a colour terminal, though other options are available.

The ASCII art produced uses this char array to represent increment
values of 1/4*sigma from the statistic's mean:
  \fB . , - ~ + * o O # @ \fP

This ranges from zero (.) on the left, to 9/4*sigma (@) on the right.
If value is zero or over the mean the char is printed green.
If it is below the mean, it's printed red. A (blue) '=' char
represents a byte value that doesn't appear in the file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \fBfiles\fP
One or more files. If no file is indicated, standard input is used.
.TP
.BR \-o\ {0 | 1 | 2 | 3}
1=no color | 2=numbers | 3=uncoloured numbers
.TP
.BR \-B
Stop processing files on first error encountered.
.TP
.BR \-b
No color. In this case, ASCII art is adjusted so the zero sigma
is at the middle of the chars array (char '*'). Increments are 1/2*sigma.
.TP
.BR \-n
Use numbers. In this case, coloured numbers are used to represent
values from 0 to 9/4*sigma.
.TP
.BR \-r
Restrict statistics to the byte values that appear in the file, not to
the 256 default. This only makes a difference if there are byte values
that do not appear in the file.
.TP
.BR \-u
Use uncoloured numbers. In this case, numbers are used to represent
positive deviations from 0 to 9/4*sigma, and letters are used to
represent negative deviations from 'a' (-0) to 'i' (-9/4)*sigma.
.TP
.BR \-h
Show summary of options.
.TP
.BR \-z\ {0-255}
Shows a second circle centered on indicated byte bucket. A zero value
is equivalent to 127 for ease of use. This way a second view of the
statistics is available for data disaggregation.
