Description: Show byte statistics as an ASCII circle graph
 bytes-circle is a program that shows statistics about bytes
 contained in a file as an ASCII circle graph of deviations from
 mean in standard deviation (sigma) fraction increments.
 .
 The program can be useful for statistically analyze the content of
 files in a glimpse: text files are shown as a green centered crown,
 compressed and encrypted files should be shown as equally distributed
 variations with a very low CV (sigma/mean), and other types of files
 can be classified between these two categories depending on their
 ASCII vs binary content, which can be useful to quickly determine how
 information is stored inside them (redis db, mmedia files, etc).
